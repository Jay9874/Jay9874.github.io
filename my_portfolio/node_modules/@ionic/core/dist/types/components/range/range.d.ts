/**
 * @virtualProp {"ios" | "md"} mode - The mode determines which platform styles to use.
 *
 * @slot label - The label text to associate with the range. Use the "labelPlacement" property to control where the label is placed relative to the range.
 * @slot start - Content is placed to the left of the range slider in LTR, and to the right in RTL.
 * @slot end - Content is placed to the right of the range slider in LTR, and to the left in RTL.
 *
 * @part label - The label text describing the range.
 * @part tick - An inactive tick mark.
 * @part tick-active - An active tick mark.
 * @part bar - The inactive part of the bar.
 * @part bar-active - The active part of the bar.
 * @part knob-handle - The container that wraps the knob and handles drag interactions.
 * @part knob-handle-a - The container for the knob with the static `A` identity when `dualKnobs` is `true`. This identity does not change, even if the knobs cross and swap which one represents the lower or upper value.
 * @part knob-handle-b - The container for the knob with the static `B` identity when `dualKnobs` is `true`. This identity does not change, even if the knobs cross and swap which one represents the lower or upper value.
 * @part knob-handle-lower - The container for the knob whose current `value` is `lower` when `dualKnobs` is `true`. The lower and upper parts swap which knob handle they refer to when the knobs cross.
 * @part knob-handle-upper - The container for the knob whose current `value` is `upper` when `dualKnobs` is `true`. The lower and upper parts swap which knob handle they refer to when the knobs cross.
 * @part pin - The value indicator displayed above a knob.
 * @part pin-a - The value indicator above the knob with the static `A` identity when `dualKnobs` is `true`. This identity does not change, even if the knobs cross and swap which one represents the lower or upper value.
 * @part pin-b - The value indicator above the knob with the static `B` identity when `dualKnobs` is `true`. This identity does not change, even if the knobs cross and swap which one represents the lower or upper value.
 * @part pin-lower - The value indicator above the knob whose current `value` is `lower` when `dualKnobs` is `true`. The lower and upper parts swap which pin they refer to when the knobs cross.
 * @part pin-upper - The value indicator above the knob whose current `value` is `upper` when `dualKnobs` is `true`. The lower and upper parts swap which pin they refer to when the knobs cross.
 * @part knob - The visual knob element on the range track.
 * @part knob-a - The visual knob for the static `A` identity when `dualKnobs` is `true`. This identity does not change, even if the knobs cross and swap which one represents the lower or upper value.
 * @part knob-b - The visual knob for the static `B` identity when `dualKnobs` is `true`. This identity does not change, even if the knobs cross and swap which one represents the lower or upper value.
 * @part knob-lower - The visual knob whose current `value` is `lower` when `dualKnobs` is `true`. The lower and upper parts swap which knob they refer to when the knobs cross.
 * @part knob-upper - The visual knob whose current `value` is `upper` when `dualKnobs` is `true`. The lower and upper parts swap which knob they refer to when the knobs cross.
 * @part activated - Added to the knob-handle, knob, and pin when the knob is active. Only one set has this part at a time when `dualKnobs` is `true`.
 * @part focused - Added to the knob-handle, knob, and pin that currently has focus. Only one set has this part at a time when `dualKnobs` is `true`.
 * @part hover - Added to the knob-handle, knob, and pin when the knob has hover. Only one set has this part at a time when `dualKnobs` is `true`.
 * @part pressed - Added to the knob-handle, knob, and pin that is currently being pressed to drag. Only one set has this part at a time when `dualKnobs` is `true`.
